This is a game made for the IB Personal Project.
Uses code from DevLogLogan and Lukky.
Plan to make the game more unique by adding my own features once I learn how to.
How to play the game:
Download the 3 files in export/exports:
Open up the .console version
Press Host to Host a Server
Check your CMD to see if it connected
Give your friends the IP (Your friends will be playing the .exe file they wont need .console file open).
They will enter it into the Address Entry, and then press Join to enter in
The game is hosted off of your personal device, and it requires uPnP so check your router settings if it doesn't seem to work
Once in the game, every player has 3 lives, infinite bullets, a double jump, and after dying they respawn at the top of the pyramid
As said in the title, its a Sandbox PVP with no rules or restrictions, just a simple test game for the Personal Project
Made Completly by SilverRockstar, with help from the Offical Godot Docs, DevLogLogan, Lukky, and the Godot Discord Server
Both GDScript files have a total of 171 lines of code, and 25 Nodes. These include the animations for the gun, the HP system, and the crosshair. It also includes the Multiplayer which is the main challenge of the game that I really wanted to learn about. Overall I had a fun time making it and I hope to be able to improve and better my game making knowledge.
I may move the full release to Itch.io, but thats for the future.
