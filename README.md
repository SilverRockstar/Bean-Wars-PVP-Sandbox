This is a game made for the IB Personal Project.
Uses code from DevLogLogan and Lukky.
Plan to make the game more unique by adding my own features once I learn how to.
How to play the game:
Open up the .console version
Press Host to Host a Server
Check your CMD to see if it connected
Give your friends the IP
They will enter it into the Address Entry, and then press join
Once in the game, every player has 3 lives, infinite bullets, a double jump, and after dying they respawn at the top of the pyramid
